# Taskero 2
Just one of my simple projects that I made to prove I know laravel. It was made in a [live streaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0BDiZMU_P4) that I did on [my YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TecnocraciaLTDA)  

This is the refactoring of an old project of mine called [Taskero](https://github.com/terremoth/taskero).
It now has more features like login, rich text editor (WYSIWYG) and mark as "completed" function.
